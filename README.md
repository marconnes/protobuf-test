# WebSocket and Protobuf Test Project

This is a TEST project to demonstrate the use of WebSocket and Protobuf in a Node.js server and a web client. This project is not meant to be used in production and is only for study purposes. I used this code to understand how to use Protobuf with Node.js, the browser, and WebSocket.
